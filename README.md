# wallet-extension
Qubic Wallet Browser Extension (Chrome MV3), built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, and Bun.

## Requirements
- Bun `>= 1.3`
- Node `>= 20` (for tooling compatibility)
- Chrome (or Chromium-based browser with extension developer mode)

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
2. Run web dev mode:
   ```bash
   bun dev
   ```
3. Build extension bundle:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```

## Scripts
- `bun dev`: Vite dev server
- `bun run dev:extension`: extension watch build to `dist-dev/`
- `bun run build`: typecheck + production build to `dist/`
- `bun run lint`: Biome checks
- `bun run format`: Biome formatting
- `bun run preview`: local preview server

## Load extension in Chrome
1. Run `bun run build`.
2. Open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable `Developer mode`.
4. Click `Load unpacked`.
5. Select the `dist/` folder.

## Fast local extension workflow
Use this when you want live updates without reloading from scratch.

1. Run:
   ```bash
   bun run dev:extension
   ```
2. In `chrome://extensions`, load `dist-dev/` once.
3. Keep the popup/sidepanel open and iterate while watch mode rebuilds.

```

## Architecture notes
- Routing uses `HashRouter` for extension-safe navigation.
- Wallet state is event-driven through storage + custom events (for account/lock updates).
- Watch-only and vault-backed accounts are both supported.
- Pending transactions are persisted locally and reconciled against network tick data.

## Security notes
- Sensitive vault data is managed through the SDK vault store.
- Passphrases/seeds are handled in-memory only during active flows and cleared on completion paths.
- App reset now clears wallet-specific keys only (scoped cleanup), not all origin storage.
- Current RPC host permission is restricted to `https://rpc.qubic.org/*`.

## Quality gates
Run these before opening a PR:

```bash
bun run lint
bunx tsc -b
bun run build
```

## Troubleshooting
- If popup looks stale, reload the extension in `chrome://extensions`.
- If account data appears out of sync, switch account once or reload the active view.
- If a local build fails after dependency changes, run:
  ```bash
  rm -rf node_modules
  bun install
  ```
